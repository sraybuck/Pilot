               <p>Mr. Collier remarks that "This word, of old, was used either as a monosyllable or
                  as a disyllable, as the case might require." This may be questioned. "<hi
                     rend="slant(italic)">Ake</hi>," says Baret in his "Alvearie," "is the Verbe of
                  the substantive <hi rend="slant(italic)">Ach</hi>, ch being turned into k." As a
                     <hi rend="slant(italic)">substantive</hi>, then, the word was written <hi
                     rend="slant(italic)">aches</hi>; and pronounced as a dissyllable: when a <hi
                     rend="slant(italic)">verb</hi>, it was written <hi rend="slant(italic)"
                     >akes</hi>, and its pronunciation was monosyllabic. This distinction is
                  invariably marked in the old text; thus, in "Romeo and Juliet," Act II. Sc. 5,
                  where it is a verb,-- <lg>
                     <l>"Lord, how my head <hi rend="slant(italic)">akes</hi>, what a head have
                        I."</l>
                  </lg> In "Coriolanus," Act III. Sc. 1,-- <lg>
                     <l>"-- and my soule akes</l>
                     <l>To know,"&amp;c.</l>
                  </lg> And in "Othello," Act IV. Sc. 2,-- <lg>
                     <l>"That the sense <hi rend="slant(italic)">akes</hi> at thee."</l>
                  </lg> While in every instance where it occurs as a substantive, it is spelt as in
                  the passage above, <hi rend="slant(italic)">aches</hi>, and should be so
                  pronounced. </p>

               <p>This is the great crux of the play. No passage in Shakespeare has occasioned more
                  speculation, and on none has speculation proved less happy. The first folio reads,
                  "Most busie <hi rend="slant(italic)">lest</hi>, when I doe it;" the second, "Most
                  busie <hi rend="slant(italic)">least</hi> when I doe it;" Pope prints, "<hi
                     rend="slant(italic)">Least busy</hi> when I do it;" Theobald, "Most <hi
                     rend="slant(italic)">busyless</hi> when I do it;" Mr. Holt White suggests,
                  "Most <hi rend="slant(italic)">busiest</hi> when I do it;" and Mr. Collier's
                  annotator, "Most busy,-- <hi rend="slant(italic)">blest</hi> when I do it."
                  Whatever may have been teh word for which "<hi rend="slant(italic)">lest</hi>" was
                  misprinted, "Most busy" and that word bore reference, unquestionably, not to
                  Ferdinand's task, but to the sweet thoughts by which it was relieved. We have
                  substituted <hi>felt</hi> as a likely word to have been mis-set "lest;" but are in
                  doubt whether <hi rend="slant(italic)">still</hi>, in its old sense of <hi
                     rend="slant(italic)">ever, always,</hi> is not preferable,-- <lg>

               <p>It was the custom of travellers, when about to make a long voyage, to put out, or
                  invest, a sum of money, upon a guaruntee that they should receive at the rate of
                  five for one if they returned. This species of gambling become so much in vogue at
                  one period that adventurers were in the practice of undertaking dangerous journeys
                  solely upon the speculation of what their <hi rend="slant(italic)"
                     >puttings-out</hi> would yield if they got back safe. Of course when the
                  journey ended fatally, the money they had invested went to the party who had
                  engaged to pay the enormous interst on it. So, in Barnaby Riche's "Faults and
                  Nothing but Faults," 1607: "Those whipsters, that, having spent the greatest part
                  of their patrimony in prodigality, will give out the rest of their stocke <hi
                     rend="slant(italic)">to be paid</hi> two or <hi rend="slant(italic)">three for
                     one</hi> upon their return form Rome." See also Fynes Moryson's "Itinerary,"
                  Part I., p. 198, and Taylor, the water poet's pamphlet, called "The Scourge of
                  Basenesse: or the Old Lerry, with a new Kicksey, and a new-cum <hi
                     rend="slant(italic)">twang</hi>, with the old Winsey." The ancient reading is
                  usually altered in modern editions to "Each putter-out of <hi rend="slant(italic)"
                     >one for five</hi>," or "Each putter-out <hi rend="slant(italic)">on</hi> five

               <p>On this passage Mr. Collier has teh following observations in his last edition:--
                  "'Noble' and 'flow' are from the corrected folio, 1632, and, we may be confident,
                  are restorations of the poet's language. Why has Prospero to call Gonzalo <hi
                     rend="slant(italic)">holy</hi>, as the epithet stands in the folios?-- he was
                  'noble' and 'honourable,' but in no respect <hi rend="slant(italic)">holy</hi>;
                  the error of <hi rend="slant(italic)">show</hi> for 'flow' is also transparent,
                  and must have been occasioned chiefly by the mistake of the long <hi
                     rend="slant(italic)">s</hi> for <hi rend="slant(italic)">f</hi>." In his
                  anxiety to sustain the changes proposed by his annotator, Mr. Collier appears to
                  have forgotten two or three facts which militate very strongly against them. In
                  the first place, the word "holy," in Shakespeare's time, besides its ordinary
                  meaning of <hi rend="slant(italic)">godly, sanctified</hi>, and the like,
                  signified also <hi rend="slant(italic)">pure, just, righteous</hi>, &amp;c.: in
                  this sense, Leontes, in "The Winter's Tale," Act V. Sc. 1, speaks of Polixenes as
                  "holy,"-- <lg>
                     <l rend="indent(2)">"You have a <hi rend="slant(italic)">holy</hi> father,</l>
                     <l>A graceful gentleman."</l>
                  </lg> In the next place, the old text has <hi rend="slant(italic)">"shew,"</hi>
                  not <hi rend="slant(italic)">show</hi>; and, thirdly, the misprint, if there were
                  one, could not have been occasioned chiefly by the mistake of the long <hi
                     rend="slant(italic)">s</hi> for <hi rend="slant(italic)">f</hi>, seeing the <hi
                     rend="slant(italic)">sh</hi> of "show" in old typography formed a single
                  character, fh, which was far less likely to be confounded with the type which
                  represented "fl"-- fl, than the single long <hi rend="slant(italic)">s</hi> with
                     <hi rend="slant(italic)">f</hi>. </p>

               <p>The striking the top masts was a new invention in Shakespeare's time, which he
                  here very properly introduces. Sir Henry Manwaring says, "It is not yet agreed
                  amongst all seamen whether it is better for a ship to hull with her topmast up or
                  down." In the Postscript to the Seaman's dictionary, he afterwards gives his own
                  opinion: "If you have sea-room, it is never good to strike the topmast."
                  Shakespeare has placed his ship in the situation in which it was indisputably
                  right to strike the topmast, when he had not sea-room.</p>

         <head>The Tempest.</head>
         <div type="prefatory">
            <p>The earliest copy of "The Tempest" known is that in the folio of 1623. To the precise
               date of its production we have no clue, but the following memorandum from the
               "Accounts of the Revels at Court," is almost positive testimony that it was written
               before 1611:--</p>
            <p>
               <hi rend="align(left)indent(1)">By the King's Players.</hi><hi rend="align(right)">
                  Hallomas nyght was presented att Whithall ye Kinges Matle, a play called the
                  Tempest</hi></p>

            <p>And the speech of Gonzalo, Act II. Sc. 1,--</p>
            <lg>
               <l>"I' the commonwealth I would by contraries," &amp;c.--</l>
            </lg>
            <p>which is obviously taken from a passage in Florio's translation of Montaigne's
               Essayes, first printed in 1603, is equally decisive as to its having been written
               after that year. The story upon which "The Tempest" is founded, was most probably
               dervied, according to Shakespeare's usual practice, from an existing play or from
               some popular chronicle or romance. Collins the poet, indeed, informed T. Warton, that
               he had met with a novel called <hi rend="slant(italic)">Aurelio and Isabella</hi>,
               printed in Italian, Spanish, French, and English, in 1588, which he conceived to have
               formed the basis of "The Tempest." When he spoke of the circumstance, however,
               Collins was labouring under mental debility, and so far as the particular novel he
               mentioned was concerned his memory deceived him, for the fable of Aurelio and
               Isabella bears no resemblance to that of the play; yet it is remarkable that a friend
               of James Boswell declared that he had once perused an Italian novel which answered to
               Collins's description. In an article on the early English and German dramas published
               in the New Monthly Magazine for January, 1841, Mr. Thoms pointed out a dramatic piece
               by Jacob Ayrer, a notary of Nurnberg, contemporary with Shakespeare, entitled <hi
                  rend="slant(italic)">Die schöne Sidea</hi>, (The Beautiful Sidea,) which bears
               some resemnblance to "The Tempest," and which Tieck conjectured was a translation of
               some old English drama from which Shakespeare borrowed his idea. How far this is
               probably the reader must judge from the following outline of the German play: Ludolph
               having been vanquished by his rival, and with his daughter Sidea driven into a
               forest, rebukes her for complaining of their change of fortune, and then summons his
               spirit Runcifal, who is, like Ariel, somewhat "moody," announces to Ludolph that the
               son of his enemy will shortly become his prisoner. After a comic episode, most
               probably introduced by the German, we see Prince Leudegast, with his son Engelbrecht
               and the councillors, hunting in the same forest; when Engelbrecht and his companion
               Famulus, having separated from the associates, are suddenly encountered by Ludolph
               and his daughter. On his commanding them to yield themselves prisoners, they refuse;
               but on attempting to draw their swords, Ludolph renders them powerless by the touch
               of his magical wand, and gives the prince over to Sidea to carry logs of wood for
               her, and to obey her commands in all respects. The resemblance between the German and
               English plays is continued in a later part of the former production, when Sidea,
               moved by pity for the labours of Engelbrecht in carrying logs, exclaims, she would
               "feel great joy, if he would prove faithful to me, and take me in wedlock;" an event
               which in the end, is happily brought about, and leads to the reconciliation of their
               parents, the rival princes. The title of "The Tempest" is supposed by some
               commentators to have been determined by the shipwreck of Sir George Sommers and Sir
               Thomas Gates on the coast of the Bermudas in 1609;</p>

            <p>of which an account was published by Silvester Jourdan,one of the crew, in the
               following year:-- <hi rend="slant(italic)">A Discovery of the Barmudas ; otherwise
                  called the Isle of Divels ; by Sir Thomas Gates, Sir George Sommers, and Captayne
                  Newport, with divers others.</hi> It is highly probable, too, that Jourdan's and
               other accounts of the Bermudas, by some of which they are said to be enchanted and
               inhabited by witches and devils, suggested the expression "still-vexed Bermoothes,"
               and induced the poet to possess his hero with necromantic influence and supernatural
               agency. Mr. Hunter, in his "Disquisition on the Scene, Origin, Date, &amp;c. of
               Shakspeare's Tempest," has laboured with great ingenuity to prove that the actual
               scene of the play was Lampedusa, "an island of the Mediterranean lying not far out of
               a ship's course passing from Tunis to Naples," and which is uninhabited, and supposed
               by sailors to be enchanted. The same idea was suggested, or occured to Douce, who
               thus speaks of it:--"The Island of Lampedusa is near the coast of Tunis ; and from
               its description, in Dapper, and the real tract of the King of Naples' voyage in
               Shakeseare's Tempest, will turn out to be the veritable island where he was
               shipwrecked, and to which Prospero had been banished, whenever the Italian novel on
               which the play founded shall be discovered." We fervently hope note; being contented
               to believe it rose, like a new Atlantis, at the summons of the poet, and when his
               magic work on it was done:-- </p>

               <p>The following observations on the maritime technicalities in this scene, are
                  extracted from an article by Lord Mulgrave, which will be found at length in
                  Boswell's Variorum edition of Shakespeare, 1821:--</p>
               <p>"The first scene of The Tempest is a very striking instance of the great accuracy
                  of Shakeseare's knowledge in a professional science, the most difficult to attain
                  without the help of experience. He must have acquired it by covnersation with some
                  of the most skilful seamen of that time. No books had then been published on the
                  subject.</p>
               <p>"The succession of events is strictly observed in the natural progress of the
                  distress described; the expedients adopted are the most proper that could have
                  been devised for a chance of safety: and it is neither to the want of skill of the
                  seamen, or the bad qualities of the ship, but solely to the power of Prospero,
                  that the shipwreck is to be attributed.</p>
               <p>"The words of command are not only strictly proper, but are only such as point the
                  object to be attained, and no suprefluous ones of detail. Shakespeare's ship was
                  too well manned to make it necessary to tell the seamen how they were to do it, as
                  well as what they were to do.</p>
               <p>"He has shown a knowledge of the new improvements, as well as the doubtful points
                  of seamanship; one of the latter he has introduced, under the only circumstance in
                  which it was indisputable.</p>
               <p>"The events certainly follow too near one another for the strict time of
                  representation: but perhaps, if the whole length of the play was divided by the
                  time allowed by the critics, the portion allotted to this scene might not be too
                  little for the whole. But he has taken care to mark intervals between the
                  different operations by exits.</p>

               <p>According to the system of witchcraft or magic, which was formed an article of
                  popular creed in Shakespeare's day, the elementary spirits were divided into six
                  classes by some demonologists, and into four,-- those of the <hi
                     rend="slant(italic)">Air</hi>, of the <hi rend="slant(italic)">Water</hi>, of
                  the <hi rend="slant(italic)">Fire</hi>, and of the <hi rend="slant(italic)"
                     >Earth</hi>,-- by others. In the list of characters appended to "The Tempest"
                  in the first folio, Ariel is called "an ayrie spirit." The particular funcions of
                  this order of beings, Burton tells us, are to cause "many tempests, thunder, and
                  lightnings, tear oaks, fire steeples, houses, strike men and beasts, make it rain
                  stones, &amp;c., cause whirlwinds on a sudden, and <hi rend="slant(italic)"
                     >tempestuous storms</hi>." But at the behest of the all-powerful magician
                  Prospero, or by his own influence and potency, the airy spirit in a twink becomes
                  not only a spirit of fire-- one of those, according to the same authority, which
                  "commonly work by blazing stars, fire drakes, or <hi rend="slant(italic)">ignes
                     fatui</hi>; *** counterfeit suns and moons, stars oftentimes, and sit upon

               <p>Hakluyt's collection of the "Voyages, Navigations, Traffiques, and Discoveries of
                  the English Nation," furnishes an interesting account of this meteor, as seen
                  during the "Voyage of Robert Tomson Marchant, into Nova Hispania, in the yeere
                  1555:"--</p>
               <p>"I do remember that in the great and boysterous storme of this foule weather, in
                  the night, there came upon the toppe of our maine yarde and maine maste, a
                  certaine little light, much like unto the light of a little candle, which the
                  Spaniards called the <hi rend="slant(italic)">Cuerpo santo</hi>, and saide it was
                     <hi rend="slant(italic)">S. Elmo</hi>, whom they take to be the advocate of
                  sailers.*** This light continued aboord our ship about three houres, flying from
                  maste to maste, and from top to top: and sometime it would be in two or three
                  places at once. I informed myself of learned men afterward what that light should
                  be, and they said, that it was but a congelation of the winde and vapours of the
                  sea congealed with the extremitie of the weather, which, flyinge in the winde,
                  many times doeth chance to hit on the masts and shrowds of the ships that are at
                  sea in foule weather. And in trueth I do take it to be so: for that I have seene
                  the like in other ships at sea, and in sundry ships at once."-- <hi

               <p>Shakespeare's first knowledge of the storm-vex'd coast of the Bermudas, was
                  probably acquired from Sir Walter Raleigh's "Discoverie of the Large, Rich, and
                  Beautiful Empire of Guiana," 1596, wherein, after speaking of the Channel of
                  Bahama, the author adds,-- "The rest of the Indies for calms, and diseases, are
                  very troublesome; and the <hi rend="slant(italic)">Bermudas</hi> a hellish sea,
                  for <hi rend="slant(italic)">thunder, lightning,</hi> and <hi rend="slant(italic)"
                     >storms</hi>." (See Chalmers' Apology, p. 578.) Or he might have derived his
                  information from Hakluyt's Voyages, 1600, in which there is a description of
                  Bermuda, by Henry May, who was shipwrecked there in 1593.</p>

               <p>It has been surmised that the idea of this marvellous creation was derived from
                  the subjoined passage in Eden's "History of Travayle in the West and East Indies,"
                  4to., London, 1577-- a book from which it is exceedingly probably that Shakespeare
                  borrowed the names of some of the principal characters of this piece, as Alonso,
                  Ferdinand, Sebastian, Gonzalo, Antonio, &amp;c.</p>

                  by chaunce they espyed a man of the stature of a giant, who came to the haven

                  our men of a meane stature came but to his waste. He was of good corporature, and
                  well made in all partes of his bodie, with a large cisage painted with divers
                  colours, but, for the most parte, yelow. Uppon his cheekes were paynted two
                  hartes, and red circles about his eyes. The heare of his head was coloured whyte,
                  and his apparell was the skynne of a beast sowde togeather. This beast, as seemed
                  unto us, had a large head, and great eares lyke unto a mule, with the body of a
                  camell and tayle of a horse. The feete of the giant were foulded in the sayde

                  Shakespeare's own copy of Florio's Montaigne, 1603, with his autograph, "William

                  Politike and Millitarie Discourses, of Lo: Michaell de Montaigne, Knight," was
                  evidently a favourite of the poet, and furnished him with the materials for
                  Gonzalo's Utopian commonwealth. The passage he has adopted occurs in the thirtieth
                  chapter of the First Book, and is headed, "Of the Caniballes:"--</p>

                  gradual dissolution; when the objects were totally hidden, the drapery was
                  withdrawn in the same manner, veil by veil, till at length even that too had

               <p>Mr. Hunter successfully exposed the error of those editors who deemed it necessary

                  he has committed a graver mistake than theirs in his ingenious endeavour to prove
                  that the "line" in this passage meant a <hi rend="slant(italic)">line-tree</hi>;--
                  "When," he observes, "Prospero says to Ariel, who comes in bringing the glittering
                  apparel, 'Come, hang them on this line,' he means on one of the line-trees near
                  his cell, which could hardly have been if the word of the original copies, <hi

                  the ear having long been familiar with <hi rend="slant(italic)">lime-grove</hi>,
                  the word suggested not the branches of a tree so-called, but a <hi

                  represented, such a line is actually drawn across the stage, and the glittering

                  dropping into the sea, became geese; and an interesting cut of these birds so

            <p>"It is observed of 'The Tempest,' that its plan is regular. This the author of 'The
               Revisal' thinks, what I think too, an accidental effect of the story, not intended or
               regarded by our author. But whatever might be Shakespeare's intention in forming or
               adopting the plot, he has made it instrumental to the production of many characters,
               diversified with boundless invention, and preserved with profound skill in nature,
               extensive knowledge of opinions, and accurate observation of life. In a single drama
               are here exhibited princes, courtiers, and sailors, all speaking in their real
               characters. There is the agency of airy spirits, and of an earthly goblin; the
               operations of magick; the tumults of a storm, the adventurs of a desart island, the
               native effusion of untaught affection, the punishment of guilt, and the final
               happiness of the pair for whom our passions and reason are equally interested."-- <hi
                  rend="case(smallcaps)">Johnson</hi>.</p>
            <p> "'The Tempest,' according to all appearance, was written in Shakespeare's later
               days: hence most critics, on the supposition that the poet must have continued to
               improve with increasing maturity of mind, have honoured this piece with a marked
               preference over the 'Midsummer Night's Dream.' I cannot, however, altogether concur
               with them: the internal merit of these two works are, in my opinion, pretty nearly
               balanced, and a predilection for the one or the other can only be governed by
               personal taste. In profound and original characterisation, the superiority of 'The
               Tempest' is obvious: as a whole we must always admire the masterly skill which he has
               here displayed in the economy of his means, and the dexterity with which he has
               disguised his preparations,-- the scaffoldings for the wonderful aërial
               structure.</p>

            <pb n="52"/>
            <p>"'The Tempest' has little action or progressive movement; the union of Ferdinand and
               Miranda is settled at their first interview, and Prospero merely throws apparent
               obstacles in their way; the shipwrecked band go leisurely about the island; the
               attempts of Sebastian and Antonio on the life of the King of Naples, and the plot of
               Caliban and the drunken sailors against Prospero, are nothing but a feint, for we
               foresee that they will be completely frustrated by the magical skill of the latter;
               nothing remains therefore but the punishment of the guilty by dreadful sights which
               harrow up their consciences, and then the discovery and final reconciliation. Yet
               this want of movement is so admirably concealed by the most varied display of the
               fascination of poetry, and the exhilaration of mirth, the details of the execution
               are so very attractive, that it requires no small degree of attention to perceive
               that the denouement is, in some degree, anticipated in the exposition. The history of
               the loves of Ferdinand and Miranda, developed in a few short scenes, is enchantingly
               beautiful: an affecting union of chivalrous magnanimity on the one part, and on the
               other of the virgin openness of a heart which, brought up far from the world on an
               uninhabited island, has never learned to disguise its innocent movements. The wisdom
               of the princely hermit Prospero has a magical and mysterious air; the disagreeable
               impression left by the black falsehood of the two usurpers is softened by the honest
               gossiping of the old and faithful Gonzalo; Trinculo and Stephano, two
               good-for-nothing drunkards, find a worthy associate in Caliban; and Ariel hovers
               sweetly over the whole as the personified genius of the wonderful fable.</p>
            <p>"Caliban has become a by-word as the strange creation of a poetical imagination. A
               mixture of gnome and savage, half demon, half brute, in his behavior we perceive at
               once the traces of his native disposition, and the influence of Prospero's education.
               The latter could only unfold his understanding, without, in the slightest degree
               taming his rooted malignity: it is as if the use of reason and human speech were
               communicated to an awkward ape. In inclination Caliban is malicious, cowardly, false,
               and base; and yet he is essentially different from the vulfar knaves of a civilized
               world, as portrayed occasionally by Shakespeare. He is rude, but not vulgar; he never
               falls into the prosaic and low familiarity of his drunken associates, for he is, in
               his way, a poetical being; he always speaks in verse. He has picked up everything
               dissonant and thorny in language to compose out of it a vocabulary of his own; and of
               the whole variety of nature, the hateful, repulsive, and pettily deformed, have alone
               been impressed on his imagination. The magical world of spirits, which the staff of
               Prospero has assembled on the island, casts merely a faint reflection into his mind,
               as a ray of light which falls into a dark cave, incapable of communicating to it
               either heat or illumination, serves merely to set in motion the poisonous vapours.
               The delineation of this monster is throughout inconceivably consistent and profound,
               and, notwithstanding its hatefulness, by no means hurtful to our feelings, as the
               honour of human nature is left untouched.</p>
            <p>"In the zephy-like Ariel, the image of air is not to be mistaken, his name even bears
               an allusion to it; as, on the other hand, Caliban signifies the heavy element of
               earth. Yet they are neither of them simple, allegorical personifications, but beings
               individually determined. In general we find in the 'Midsummer Night's Dream,' in 'The
               Tempest,' in the magical part of 'Macbeth,' and wherever Shakespeare avails himself
               of the popular belief in the invisible presence of spirits, and the possibility of
               coming in contact with them, a profound view of the inward life of nature and her
               mysterious springs, which, it is true, can never be altogether unknown to the genuine
               poet, as poetry is altogether incompatible with the mechanical physics, but which few
               have possessed in an equal degree with Dante and himself."--<hi
