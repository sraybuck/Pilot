            <salute>My Dear Cockburn</salute>
         </opener>
         <p>I have too much reliance on your 
            <lb/><choice><orig>antient</orig><reg>ancient</reg></choice> friendship to make you any long apology
            <lb/> for introducing to you a young English friend to
            <lb/>whom any casual attention you can pay will be doing 
            <lb/>me a gratifying kindness―This will be <unclear cert="high">delivered</unclear> to you
            <lb/>by <persName>Mʳ Adams</persName> the son of <unclear cert="low">Commissioner</unclear> Adams―He is a
            <lb/>young man intended for the church of the most respectable
            + amiable character―I have known his family since he was
            <lb/>born—&amp; I think it but right in commending him to your
            <lb/><unclear cert="medium">friendship</unclear> as he passes through <unclear cert="low">Edingh</unclear> to mention that
            
            <pb/>
            
            <lb/>I introduce him not as a common acquaintance but
            <lb/>as a person in whose happiness I am very much <unclear cert="medium">interested.</unclear>
            <lb/>He + his family are Tories but in spite of this I have
            <lb/>been on terms of mutual regard with them for three
            <lb/>generations—The young man himself has something
            <lb/>in his nature that will now allow him to be an
            <lb/><emph rend="underscore">illiberal</emph> &amp; therefore I like to introduce him among
            <lb/>the Whigs—as I believe that intercourse with them
            <lb/>will insensibly conciliate &amp; alter his hereditary feelings
            <lb/>in polities—
         </p>
         <p>I have not forgot your kindess in interfer­
            <lb break="no"/>­ing with <unclear cert="low">Wardlaw</unclear>—It did much good—I trust this
            <lb/>will find you + yours all well—I remain
         </p>
         <closer>
            <signed>My dear Cockburn
               <lb/>with very warm + old recollections
               <lb/>yours truly <persName>T. Campbell</persName>
            </signed>
         </closer>
         
         <pb/>
         
         <postscript>
            <p>P.S. Will you permit me to include in my introduction
               <lb/><persName>Mʳ Barber</persName> the College Companion + fellow <unclear cert="medium">travel­</unclear>
               <lb/>­er of <persName>Mʳ Adams</persName>—
