- What passing-bells for these who die as cattle?
- {:.indent-1} Only the monstrous anger of the guns.
- {:.indent-1} Only the stuttering rifles' rapid rattle
- Can patter out their hasty orisons.
- No mockeries for them; no prayers nor bells,
- Nor any voice of mourning save the choirs,-
- The shrill, demented choirs of wailing shells;
- And bugles calling for them from sad shires.

- What candles may be held to speed them all?
- {:.indent-1} Not in the hands of boys, but in their eyes
- Shall shine the holy glimmers of goodbyes.
- The pallor of girls' brows shall be their pall;
- Their flowers the tenderness of patient minds,
- And each slow dusk a drawing-down of blinds.
